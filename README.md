# FitCut-Implementation
An Implementation from "Scalable Circuit Cutting and Scheduling in a Resource-constrained and Distributed Quantum System"

# Note Update

Due to the Integration of Community Detection, which was developed back in 2008, this project now has to run under Linux
this project is not supported on MacOS

make sure you have install Graphviz(also through apt-get) on your computer to see the graph

# Note: run the project

make sure you have access locally to the executable in folder "CommunityDetection"

set your working folder as the "FitCut-Implementation" to avoid problem of path

run "__main__.py" and you will see the progress so far
