# FitCut-Implementation
An Implementation from "Scalable Circuit Cutting and Scheduling in a Resource-constrained and Distributed Quantum System"

# Setting up your environment

> Due to the Integration of Community Detection, which was developed
> back in 2008, this project now has to run under Linux.

Install necessary libraries using pip
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install Graphviz
```bash
sudo apt-get install graphviz
```

# Running the project

Download `CommunityDetectionExecutable` which can be found here: https://sites.google.com/site/findcommunities/

Set your working directory `/FitCut-Implementation` to avoid path resolution issues

Run this command to run the project
```bash
python3 __main__.py
```
or
```bash
python __main__.py
```

# Note

To review the code status before submission deadline, please refer to "commit 9d03ab11e0c079a03918baf123524477a6a1412e"

All update after 09.Jan.2025 was purely out of our wish to fully implement the algorithm from the paper, and shall not be taken in to consideration of grading.
